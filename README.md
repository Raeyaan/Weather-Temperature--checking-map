# Weather Map

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for a location and display the current weather at that location. Users can enter a location in the search bar, or click on the map to drop a pin at a specific location.

The application uses the **OpenStreetMap** tiles and **Leaflet** library for the map display. It also uses the **OpenCage** Geocoding API to convert user-entered addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates, and the **OpenWeatherMap** API to retrieve weather information for a given location.

Usage
To use the application, simply open **index.html** in your web browser. The application will load a map of the world centered on the UK, and a search bar at the top right corner of the screen.

To search for a location, enter an address or location in the search bar and click on the **Search** button. The application will drop a pin on the map at the location of the address, and display the current temperature at that location in a popup.

Alternatively, you can click anywhere on the map to drop a pin at a specific location. The application will display the current temperature at that location in a popup.
